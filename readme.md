# pridex16.bas

I saw (mostly listened) to NCommander's charity stream for the [Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/) where he made a Win16 GDI program to dynamically draw pride flags. That game me an idea that resulted in my very first graphical basic program.

It's for the [Commander X16](https://www.commanderx16.com) modern retro computer. I don't have one but the emulator works fine.  
As of writing (11-28-2022) the web emulator fails if you try to draw below line 200 so use the Win/Linux/Mac version.
